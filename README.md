# TFM: PREDICTING EUROPEAN IDENTITY

Only the main script (TFM) and the aggregate-level databases (with country-level variables) are uploaded to this repository.

The main databases (individual-level) are from the Eurobarometer, but they are not uploaded to this repository since they are too large.
The Eurobarometer databases must be downloaded from GESIS. 
The Eurobarometers used are: ZA7649 (2020), ZA7780 (2021), ZA7848 (2022), ZA7953 (2023)
